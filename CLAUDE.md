# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a PDF Editor application project currently in the planning/design phase. The repository contains a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD.md) that outlines the vision for building a desktop PDF editing application.

## Current State

The project has been initialized with a working Electron + React + TypeScript application:
- âœ… Complete project structure with Electron main process and React renderer
- âœ… TypeScript configuration for both main and renderer processes
- âœ… Vite build system with Tailwind CSS styling
- âœ… PDF import/export functionality using PDF-lib and PDF.js
- âœ… Modern UI with header, sidebar, and main canvas
- âœ… File system integration for opening and saving PDFs
- âœ… Basic PDF loading and display architecture
- ðŸ”„ PDF editing features (ready for implementation)

## Planned Architecture

Based on the PRD, this will be a desktop application with the following tech stack:
- **Platform**: Desktop application (Electron + React)
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **PDF Library**: PDF-lib.js or Electron-PDF
- **State Management**: Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS + Headless UI
- **Build Tool**: Vite + Electron Builder
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library

## Development Environment

**Virtual Environment**: 
- A Python 3.13 virtual environment is set up in `venv/`
- Activate with: `source venv/bin/activate` (macOS/Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)

**Common Commands**:
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run development server: `npm run dev`
- Build for production: `npm run build`
- Build application package: `npm run build:app`
- Build renderer only: `npm run build:vite`
- Build main process only: `npm run build:electron`

## Core Features to Implement

The application will have these major feature areas:
1. **Document Management**: PDF import/export, creation, file handling
2. **Text Editing**: In-place text editing, formatting, search/replace
3. **Page Management**: Add/delete/reorder pages, rotation, resizing
4. **Visual Elements**: Image insertion, shapes, drawing tools, forms
5. **Document Structure**: Bookmarks, TOC, metadata, links, annotations
6. **Document Cleaning**: Optimization, duplicate removal, structure validation
7. **Export/Sharing**: Multiple format export, print functionality

## Development Phases

The project is planned in 4 phases:
- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Core PDF editing functionality
- **Phase 2**: Visual elements and document cleaning
- **Phase 3**: Professional features and batch processing
- **Phase 4**: Polish, optimization, and accessibility

## Key Requirements

- **Privacy-first**: Local processing only, no cloud uploads
- **Cross-platform**: Windows, macOS, and Linux support
- **Performance**: Handle documents up to 500MB, smooth 60fps interactions
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
